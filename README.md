# Caesar-Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This Python program encodes and decodes messages by shifting letters while preserving case and leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. It's used for basic cryptography.
